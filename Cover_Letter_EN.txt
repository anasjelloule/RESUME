Re: Application for [Job Title] Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the [Job Title] position at [Company Name]. As a Tech Lead with a proven track record of building production-grade platforms from scratch, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

At MyTeam 360, I designed and developed a complete collaborative sports management platform that has been adopted by the FRMF (Royal Moroccan Football Federation), professional clubs, and football academies. This experience allowed me to:

• Architect a Microservices solution (Node.js/Express + Angular/React) handling thousands of users
• Lead a team of 3 developers with Code Review practices and technical mentorship
• Build complex modules including sports performance tracking (GPS, HOOPER, RPE), video analysis, and Data Science integration
• Manage infrastructure on DigitalOcean with Linux automation and scheduled tasks (Cron, BullMQ)

I am currently pursuing my State Engineering Degree in Software Engineering at High Tech School, continuously strengthening my expertise in system architecture and technical leadership.

What excites me about [Company Name] is [mention something specific about their product, tech stack, culture, or recent projects]. I believe my experience in building scalable products, combined with my DevOps mindset, would be valuable assets for your team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills could contribute to your projects. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,


Anas Jelloul
